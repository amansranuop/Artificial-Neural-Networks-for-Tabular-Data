# Artificial-Neural-Networks-for-Tabular-Data

This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn, which is when customers leave or stop using a service. By looking at customer data, the model finds patterns that suggest when someone might leave. This helps businesses make informed decisions to keep their customers and reduce churn.
